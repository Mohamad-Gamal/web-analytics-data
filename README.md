The three images you provided appear to show a data analytics dashboard, displaying key performance metrics and visualizations related to web traffic, bounces, exits, and page performance over time. Hereâ€™s a summary of the main insights from each section:

1. Image 1: Overview of Web Traffic and Engagement Metrics
Total Bounces: 90K

Total Exits: 139K

Total Pageviews: 855K

Total Sessions: 418K

Average Time on Page: 98.49 seconds

Average Page Load Time: 71.61 seconds

The bar chart shows the sum of bounces and exits over several quarters (Q2 2017 to Q3 2019), highlighting the general upward trend in web traffic engagement metrics.

The map visualization breaks down the channel groupings (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet) by device category and region, with heavy traffic in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia and Africa.

2. Image 2: Breakdown by Source Medium and Page Performance
The top bar chart lists total bounces by source medium, with referral traffic from websites like Indiegogo, Google Brazil, Xrea, Amazon Japan, and The Guardian being significant contributors.

The line chart below shows the sum of page load time (in blue) and sum of time on page (in red) over time, which exhibits fluctuations across different quarters. It highlights critical insights into web performance and user retention based on loading times.

3. Image 3: Pageviews and Bounce Rate Analysis
The stacked bar chart shows the total pageviews and unique pageviews for each quarter from Q2 2017 to Q3 2019. The trend indicates that most quarters maintain steady or increasing pageviews.

The table breaks down detailed performance metrics for individual pages, including total pageviews, bounces, load time, unique pageviews, and bounce rate. Some pages with high pageviews have higher bounce rates, possibly due to slow load times, which is highlighted in the summary at the bottom.

The summary suggests that page load time is a significant factor affecting bounce rates, where pages with longer load times tend to have a higher bounce rate. However, overall, pageviews have steadily increased over time.
